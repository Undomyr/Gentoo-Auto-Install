# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only version that exists currently . Wouldn't even call it an alpha.  

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| [alpha](https://github.com/Undomyr/Gentoo-Auto-Install/blob/Develop/Gentoo_Install_Script.sh)    | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I don't expect there to be any from the bulk of code, since it's a Bash-script using mostly
command and standard packages and tools. 

Security risks, if any, would most likely come from how those commands are knit together. 

If you find a section or function that contains a security risk, please submit an issue for it,
and include the lines involved. If you find a solution, please include a diff.
